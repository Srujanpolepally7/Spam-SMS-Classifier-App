# Spam-SMS-Classifier-App

Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language
Today, I will explain you how to Build a SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning in Python

We will use algorithms such as :-
Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
Support Vector Machine

For this project, we will use python libraries like:-
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
